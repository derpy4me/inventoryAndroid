# Overview

This is an introduction into the use of developing Android applications with Kotlin and using the Android Studio IDE.

This is is a very basic implementation of an inventory management app. User will be provided with a single item to purchase.  
The user will also be able to sell purchased items. Money will be displayed and a button will also be provided to exit the application.

This project gave me the opportunity to develop an application of my choice using the Android Studio IDE and Kotlin.  
This was a learning experience where I learned xml, Kotlin and using the designer provided with the Android Studio IDE.
